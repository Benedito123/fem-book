======= A quick introduction to the finite element method =======
label{fem:quick}

Understanding all details of the computational machinery of the finite element
method, which is the goal of this book, is a time-consuming and demanding
undertaking. Before diving into the details, it is wise to get a brief
overview of the most important ideas of the finite element algorithm.
The following text tries to communicate such an overview through a
specific example.

===== PDE problem =====

The finite element method is primarily used for spatial discretization so
we target a PDE problem without the time coordinate:

!bt
\begin{align}
-\nabla\cdot\left( \dfc\nabla u\right) & f,
\quad\x\in\Omega,
label{fem:quick:PDE}\\
u &= u_0,\quad\x\in\partial\Omega_D,
label{fem:quick:Dirichlet}\\
-\dfc\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &= g,\quad\x\in\partial\Omega_N
label{fem:quick:Neumann}
\tp
\end{align}
!et
Here,

 * $\Omega$ is an arbitrary spatial domain in 1D, 2D, or 3D
 * The boundary $\partial\Omega$ of $\Omega$ is divided into two
   non-overlapping parts $\partial\Omega_D$ and $\partial\Omega_N$
 * $u(\x)$ is the unknown function
 * $\dfc(\x)$, $u_0(\x)$, and $g(\x)$ are known functions

Our goal is to seek an approximate solution, often named $u_h\approx
u$ in the literature, but in this text we almost exclusively talk
about the approximate solution, so we reserve $u$ for that quantity
and introduce $\uex$ as the exact solution of
(ref{fem:quick:PDE})-(ref{fem:quick:Neumann}) - when we occasionally need it.

===== Discretization of the domain =====

Show a mesh and explain it. Rectangle with circular hole?

===== Mesh function =====

Introduce the idea. Show figures of basis functions.

===== Variational formulation =====

State the principle/idea, show final result. Tell what it implies of
computations.

===== The element-wise algorithm =====

===== FEniCS =====
