</div>
<p>The finite element method is a versatile approach to construct
computational schemes to solve any partial differential equation on
any domain in any dimension. The method may at first glance appear
cumbersome and even unnatural as it relies on variational formulations
and polynomial spaces. However, the study of these somewhat abstract
concepts pays off as the finite element method provides a general
recipe for efficient and accurate simulations.</p>
<p>Let us start by outlining the concepts briefly.
Consider the following PDE in 2D:</p>
<div class="math">
\[-\nabla^2 u = -u_{xx} - u_{yy} = f,\]</div>
<p>equipped with suitable boundary conditions.
A finite difference scheme to solve the current PDE
would in the simplest case be described by the stencil</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-2d-fdm0">
\[\tag{1}
-\frac{u_{i-1,j} - 2 u_{i,j} + u_{i+1,j}}{h^2}
    -\frac{u_{i,j-1} - 2 u_{i,j} + u_{i,j+1}}{h^2}
     = f_{i}\]</div>
<p>or reordered to the more famous</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-2d-fdm">
\[\tag{2}
\frac{-u_{i-1,j} -u_{i,j-1} + 4 u_{i,j} - u_{i+1,j} -u_{i,j+1}}{h^2}  = f_{i}
    {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>On a structured mesh, the stencil appears natural and
is convenient to implement.
However, for a unstructured, &#8220;complicated&#8221;domain
as shown in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#overview-meshex"><span class="std std-ref">Example on a complicated domain for solving PDEs</span></a>,
we would need to be careful when placing
points and evaluating stencils and functions.  Both accuracy and efficiency
may easily be sacrificed by a reckless implementation.</p>
<p>In general, a domain like the one represented in Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#overview-meshex"><span class="std std-ref">Example on a complicated domain for solving PDEs</span></a> will be representation by a triangulation. The
finite element method (and the finite volume method which often is a
special case of the finite element method) is a methodology for
creating stencils like <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-2d-fdm"><span class="std std-ref">(2)</span></a> in a structured manner
that adapt to the underlying triangulation.</p>
<p>The triangulation in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#overview-meshex"><span class="std std-ref">Example on a complicated domain for solving PDEs</span></a> is a mesh that
consists of cells that are connected and defined in terms of
vertices. The fundamental idea of the finite element method is
to construct a procedure to compute a stencil on a general element and
then apply this procedure to each element of the mesh. Let
us therefore denote the mesh as <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> while <span class="math">\(\Omega_e\)</span> is the domain
of a generic element such that <span class="math">\(\Omega=\cup_e \Omega_e\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is exactly the point where the challenges of the finite element
method starts and where we need some new concepts.  The basic question
is: How should we create a stencil like <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-2d-fdm"><span class="std std-ref">(2)</span></a> for a
general element and a general PDE that has the maximal accuracy and
minimal computational complexity at the current triangulation?  The
two basic building blocks of the finite element method are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the solution is represented in terms of a polynomial expression on the
given general element, and</li>
<li>a variational formulation of the PDE
where element-wise integration enables the PDE to be transformed to a
stencil.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 is, as will be explained later, conveniently represented
both implementation-wise and mathematically as a solution</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-u-fem">
\[\tag{3}
u = \sum_{i=0}^N c_i {\psi}_i(x,y),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\{c_i\}\)</span> are the coefficients to be determined
(often called the degrees of freedom)
and <span class="math">\({\psi}_i(x,y)\)</span> are prescribed polynomials.
The next step is the variational formulation. This step
may seem like a trick of magic or a cumbersome
mathematical exercise at first glance.
We take the PDE and multiply by a function <span class="math">\(v\)</span> (usually called a
the test function)
and integrate over an element <span class="math">\(\Omega_e\)</span> and obtain the expression</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-poisson">
\[\tag{4}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v {\, \mathrm{d}x} =  \int_{\Omega_e} f \, v {\, \mathrm{d}x}\]</div>
<p>A perfectly natural question at this point is: Why multiply
with a test function <span class="math">\(v\)</span>? The simple answer is that
there are <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> unknowns that needs to be determined in <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-u-fem"><span class="std std-ref">(3)</span></a>
and for this we need <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> equations. The equations are
obtained by using  <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> different test functions which when used
in  <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-fem-a"><span class="std std-ref">(5)</span></a>
give rise to <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> linearly independent equations.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">While <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-poisson"><span class="std std-ref">(4)</span></a> is a variational formulation of
our PDE problem, it is not the most common form.
It is common to re-write</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-fem-a">
\[\tag{5}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v {\, \mathrm{d}x}\]</div>
<p>to weaken the requirement of the polynomial space used for the
trial function (that here needs to be twice differentiable)
and write this term on its corresponding weak form.
That
is, the term is rewritten in terms of first-derivatives only (of
both the trial and the test function)  with the aid of Gauss-Green&#8217;s lemma:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-overview-fem-a-weak">
\[\tag{6}
\int_{\Omega_e} -\nabla^2 u \, v {\, \mathrm{d}x}  =
    \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}   - \int_{\partial \Omega_e} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \,  v \,  dS\]</div>
<p>The reasons behind this alternative formulation is rather mathematical and will
not be a major subject of this book as it is well described elsewhere.
In fact, a precise explanation would need tools from functional analysis.</p>
<p>With the above rewrite assuming now that the boundary term vanish due to
boundary conditions (why this is possible will be dealt with in detail
later in this book) the
stencil, corresponding to <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-2d-fdm"><span class="std std-ref">(2)</span></a>,  is represented by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is called the <em>trial function</em>, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is called a <em>test function</em>,
and <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> is an element of
a triangulated mesh. The idea of software like FEniCS is that this
piece of mathematics can be directly expressed in terms of Python code as</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mesh</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Mesh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;some_file&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">V</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FunctionSpace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mesh</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;some polynomial&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TrialFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">V</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TestFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">V</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">dot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">grad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">grad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">dx</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The methodology and code in this example is not tied to a particular
equation, except the formula for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, holding the derivatives of our
sample PDE, but any other PDE terms could be expressed via <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">v</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">grad</span></code>, and other symbolic operators in this line of code.  In fact,
finite element packages like FEniCS are typically structured as
general toolboxes that can be adapted to any PDE as soon as the
derivation of variational formulations is mastered.  The main obstacle
here for a novice FEM user is then to understand the concept of trial
functions and test functions realised in terms of polynomial spaces.</p>
<p>Hence, a finite element formulation (or a weak formulation) of
the Poisson problem that works on any mesh <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> can be written
in terms of solving the problem:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla vd{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_\Omega fv{\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>By varying the trial and test spaces we obtain different stencils,
some of which will be identical to finite difference schemes on
particular meshes. We will now show a complete FEniCS program to
illustrate how a typical finite element code may be structured</p>

<p>While the finite element method is versatile and may be adapted to any
PDE on any domain in any dimension, the different methods that are
derived by using different trial and test functions may vary
significantly in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In fact, even
though the process of deriving at a variational formulation is
general, a bad choice of polynomial space may in some cases lead to a
completely wrong result. This is particularly the case for complicated
PDEs. For this reason, it is dangerous to regard the method as a black
box and not do proper verification of the method for a particular
application.</p>
<p>In this book we will put focus on verification in the sense
that we provide the reader with explicit calculations as
well as demonstrations of how such computations can be performed
by using symbolic or numerical calculations to control the
various parts of the computational framework. In our view, there
are three important tests that should be frequently employed
during verification:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>reducing the model problem to 1D and carefully check the calculations involved in the variational formulation on a small 1D mesh</li>
<li>perform the calculation involved on one general or random element</li>
<li>test whether convergence is obtained and to what order the method converge by refining the mesh</li>
</ol>
<p>The two first task here should ideally be performed by independent calculations
outside the framework used for the simulations. In our view <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sympy</span></code> is a
convenient tool that can be used to assist hand calculations.</p>
<p>So far, we have outlined how the finite element method handles derivatives
in a PDE, but we also had a right-hand side <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. This term is multiplied
by the test function <span class="math">\(v\)</span> as well, such that the entire Poisson equation
is transformed to</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla vd{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_\Omega fv{\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This statement is assumed valid for all test functions <span class="math">\(v\)</span> in some
function space <span class="math">\(V\)</span> of polynomials. The right-hand side expression is
coded in FEniCS as</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">L</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">dx</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the problem is then solved by the statements</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">V</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># unknown FEM function</span>
<span class="n">solve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">L</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bc</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bc</span></code> holds information about boundary conditions. This information
is connected to information about the triangulation, the <em>mesh</em>.
Assuming <span class="math">\(u=0\)</span> on the boundary, we can in FEniCS generate a triangular
mesh over a rectangular domain <span class="math">\([-1,-1]\times [-1,1]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mesh</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">RectangleMesh</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">nx</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ny</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">bc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DirichletBC</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">V</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;on_boundary&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Mathematically, the finite element method transforms our PDE to
a sparse linear system. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solve</span></code> step performs two tasks:
construction of the linear system based on the given information about
the domain and its elements, and then solution of the linear system by
either an iterative or direct method.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to summarize all the parts of a FEniCS program
that solves the Poisson equation by the finite element method:</p>

<p>Solving a different PDE is a matter of changing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">L</span></code>. We refer to
the FEniCS tutorial <a class="reference internal" href="._book036.html#ref07" id="id1">[Ref07]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="._book036.html#ref08" id="id2">[Ref08]</a> for lots of examples.</p>
<p>Although we assert here that the finite element method is a tool that
can solve any PDE problem on any domain of any complexity, the
fundamental ideas of the method are in fact even more general. This
book will emphasize this general framework and show how the finite
element method is actually just one way to choose the expansion
functions <span class="math">\({\psi}\)</span>, but there are many others, giving rise to other
frameworks for other problems, such as uncertainty quantification via
polynomial chaos theory in the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book033.html#ch-pc"><span class="std std-ref">Uncertainty quantification and polynomial chaos expansions</span></a>. By understanding the
general framework of approximations of the form <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-overview-u-fem"><span class="std std-ref">(3)</span></a>,
i.e, understanding how <span class="math">\({\psi}_i\)</span> are constructed and how <span class="math">\(c_i\)</span> are
computed, we believe the reader can develop a better intuitive
understanding the finite element method in particular and its
foundation in general.</p>

<span id="ch-approx-global"></span><h1>Function approximation by global functions<a class="headerlink" href="#function-approximation-by-global-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Many successful numerical solution methods for differential equations,
including the finite element method,
aim at approximating the unknown function by a sum</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fem-u">
\[\tag{7}
u(x) \approx \sum_{i=0}^N c_i{\psi}_i(x),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\({\psi}_i(x)\)</span> are prescribed functions and <span class="math">\(c_0,\ldots,c_N\)</span>
are unknown coefficients to be determined.
Solution methods for differential equations
utilizing <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-fem-u"><span class="std std-ref">(7)</span></a> must
have a <em>principle</em> for constructing <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> equations to
determine <span class="math">\(c_0,\ldots,c_N\)</span>. Then there is a <em>machinery</em> regarding
the actual constructions of the equations for <span class="math">\(c_0,\ldots,c_N\)</span>, in a
particular problem. Finally, there is a <em>solve</em> phase for computing
the solution <span class="math">\(c_0,\ldots,c_N\)</span> of the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> equations.</p>
<p>Especially in the finite element method, the machinery for
constructing the discrete equations to be implemented on a computer is
quite comprehensive, with many mathematical and implementational
details entering the scene at the same time. From an ease-of-learning
perspective it can therefore be wise to follow an idea of Larson and
Bengzon <a class="reference internal" href="._book036.html#ref06" id="id3">[Ref06]</a> and introduce the computational machinery
for a trivial equation: <span class="math">\(u=f\)</span>. Solving this equation with <span class="math">\(f\)</span> given
and <span class="math">\(u\)</span> on the form <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-fem-u"><span class="std std-ref">(7)</span></a>, means that we seek an approximation
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.  This approximation problem has the advantage of
introducing most of the finite element toolbox, but without involving
demanding topics related to differential equations (e.g., integration
by parts, boundary conditions, and coordinate mappings).  This is the
reason why we shall first become familiar with finite element
<em>approximation</em> before addressing finite element methods for
differential equations.</p>
<p>First, we refresh some linear algebra concepts about approximating
vectors in vector spaces. Second, we extend these concepts to
approximating functions in function spaces, using the same principles
and the same notation.  We present examples on approximating functions
by global basis functions with support throughout the entire
domain. That is, the functions are in general nonzero on the entire
domain.  Third, we introduce the finite element type of basis
functions globally.  These basis functions will later,
in ref {ch:approx:fe},
be used with local support
(meaning that each function is nonzero except in a small part of the domain)
to enhance stability and efficiency.
We explain all details of the
computational algorithms involving such functions.  Four types of
approximation principles are covered: 1) the least squares method, 2)
the <span class="math">\(L_2\)</span> projection or Galerkin method, 3) interpolation or
collocation, and 4) the regression method.</p>
