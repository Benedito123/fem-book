* Make exercises with the nonlinear intro examples from LNCSE2! Fun with u^2
  nonlinearity and convergence rate etc. Implement solutions based on diffu.
  Can make separate Picard and Newton exercises.
* FDM book: use this chapter but take out FEM topics.
* FEM book: just include the whole chapter since FDM is often referred to in that book.
* Get the Newton-Picard combination formula into the FEniCS tutorial too.
* In FEM 1D examples with nonlinear diffusion coefficient,
  use a group finite element method with P0 element and interpret the
  coefficient as a kind of average of the coefficient over the element.
  This allows for a harmonic mean using end points and is a way to
  introduce harmonic mean in FEM! Could be a very nice exercise or example.
* Gustav's final `diffu` project is excellent. Use it when writing here
  about FEM and nonlinear PDEs.
* Finite difference Jacobian is very easy to implement when the Newton
  solver employs a Krylov method as we need to just do
  $Jv = (F(u + hv) - F(u))/h$. See how it fits in a FEM and FEniCS context.
  Derivation: $Jv = dF_i/x_j*v_j$ is the derivative of F in direction of v.
  This is called Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method. See D. A. Knoll and
  D. E. `Keyes`: Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods: a survey of approaches
  and applications, `JCP`, 193, 357-397, 2004. See `ideas/5620/nonlin`,
  very extensive review article. Note that one can either do $F(u+hv)$
  or use a Taylor expansion (relevant for a matrix-free method that
  avoids calling $F$).
* Find biology examples for f(u) and coefficients and make cases.
* Compute full Jacobian for FDM and FEM in case \dfc = \dfc(|\nabla u|),
  first 1D in text, then 2D in exercise - need a special development
  since we don't need to averge \dfc
* Describe IMEX methods, see ideas-new14/5620/IMEX...pdf for u_t = L(u) + f(u),
  where L is the linear term. The paper has three illustrating methods
  for implicit time discretization, but then linearizing the f term. Can
  be interpreted as one-pass Picard. Search for more IMEX. Note the use
  of Leapfrog-CN (see what it does for linear problems). These ideas
  can be developed for pure ODEs first?
* Make a derivation of the Newton system with F and J expressed solely
  by u and v such that we can easily code J as an "a" and F as an "L"
  in FEniCS
* Must develop non-Newtonian time-dep flow model as a 1D example and as a 0D
  example with sine expansion in half of the channel (can have abs
  version for the whole channel too to see if it makes a difference),
  a FDM model is fine, need to demonstrate both Jacobian and
  the use of continuation method in 1D and 0D. Using sines and Galerkin
  leads to integrals that sympy cannot handle. Collocation is probably
  better, gives (N=0) typically y' = -C*y**n, and (BE) nonlinear eq
  of the form y + dt*C*y**n = y_1. Seems very difficult to solve
  from a plot because of a very steep front very close to y=0.
* 2D finite difference nonlinear example, first just source term
* Logistic problem: draw the parabola at each time level, mark
  the convergence of Picard or Newton as discs, introduce a
  relaxation parameter. Is it possible (from the graphs) that the
  wrong root can be picked?
* Discretize a nonlinear heat conduction problem by one sine function,
  use Galerkin or colloction, and derive one nonlinear algebraic equation.
  Investiate as above: draw the function at each time level.
  Experiment with different types of nonlinear diffusion coefficients.
* Should at least quote Kelly and results on Picard and Newton
  convergence, e.g., that Newton converges quadratically.
