The definite local source is Joakim's 5620 project on his bitbucket
account. Splendid! CHeck also Imran's project in imranal/ns_rans on
bitbucket (good for deriving var forms in vector notation and for
RANS models).

Outline:

 * Chorin
 * IPCS
 * Variational formulation, vector formulation
 * Variational formulation, scalar version
 * Read the AWR paper, Kent's notes based on it, Imran's report
 * Add info on stabilization methods
 * Fully implicit method
 * FEniCS impl vector vs scalar version
 * finite differences in space...
