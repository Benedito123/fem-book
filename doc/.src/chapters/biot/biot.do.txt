======= Introduction =======

Soil, rock, and sponges are examples of porous materials where a
solid skeleton contains pores filled with a fluid like air or water.
The solid skeleton is often elastic and may deform because of the
movement of the fluid. We shall refer to such fluid-solid mixtures
as *porous media*. The physics of porous media is essential in
numerous application areas. Three primary examples are listed below.


  * *Hydrocarbon recovery*: rock is a porous medium where oil, water,
     and gas flow during oil and gas production.

  * *Buildings on soil*: soil is a porous medium containing air and
     water, and the weight of a heavy building will cause the soil to
     deform (consolidate).

  * *Biomedical processes*: the spinal chord and the brain are
     examples on porous materials that deform due to movement of a
     fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, often known as CSF). through



In the following, we shall present the partial differential equations
(PDEs) modeling flow and deformation in porous media. These equations
are commonly known as the *Biot equations*.

======= Mathematical Model =======

The Biot equations we work with here are based on a series of physical
assumptions. The porosity of the material must be small (thus leaving
out sponges as porous media described by the Biot model).  We also
assume that there is only one fluid filling *all* the pores inside the
medium.  The deformation of the solid skeleton is small and elastic
such that standard linear elasticity theory applies. We shall also
assume that the fluid is incompressible or at most slightly
compressible.  Temperature effects are neglected, but can relatively
easily be incorporated.  Regarding time scales, we leave out wave
motion and consider slow or stationary processes.

The Biot equations reduce to one vector PDE governing the deformation
of the solid skeleton and one scalar PDE governing the pressure (and
hence the flow) of the fluid.

We introduce the following mathematical quantities, which will frequently
appear in the equations:

TABLE!


  * $\u$: displacement of the solid skeleton,

  * $\bm{q}$: relative velocity of the fluid and the solid skeleton,

  * $p$: pressure in the fluid,

  * $\varrho_s$: solid density,

  * $\varrho_f$: fluid density,

  * $\mu$: fluid viscosity (dynamic),

  * $K$: isotropic (scalar) permeability,

  * $\bm{K}$: anisotropic permeability tensor,

  * $\stress $: total stress tensor in the solid skeleton,

  * $\stress '$: effective stress tensor due to deformation,

  * $\strain$: strain tensor corresponding to $\stress$ through Hooke's law,

  * $\Omega$: spatial domain occupied by the porous medium,

  * $[0,T]$: time interval under consideration.


===== Solid phase =====

The equations in the solid are based on Newton's second law, which for
a continuum with stress tensor $\stress$, displacement (or
deformation) field $\u$, and external body forces $\f$ reads

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho_s\frac{\partial^2\u}{\partial t^2} = \nabla\cdot\stress + \varrho_s\f
\thinspace .
label{biot:solid:momentum}
\end{equation}
!et
The acceleration term on the left-hand side is important for wave
motion, but for the slow flow and deformation processes considere here
the term can be neglected. The most common form of $\f$ is the
gravity force, here denoted by $\bm{g}$.

The concept of *effective stress* is important in porous media.
The effective stress $\stress '$ represents the stress carried by
the solid skeleton and is related to the deformations of the solid.
The total stress $\stress$ is the sum of the effective stress and the stress
induced by the fluid in the skeleton. The latter is expressed through
the isotropic stress tensor $-\alpha p\I$. We then have

!bt
\begin{equation}
\stress  = \stress' - \alpha p\I,
label{biot:effective:stress}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\I$ is the identity tensor and $\alpha$ is the Biot-Willis
parameter, which equals unity for incompressible fluids (see below).
Hooke's generalized law for
three-dimensional elasticity in an isotriopic elastic medium is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\stress'  = \lambda \mbox{tr}\strain\I + 2\mu\strain,
label{biot:effstress:strain}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\strain$ is the strain tensor related to the displacements $\u$ by

!bt
\begin{equation}
\strain  = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right)
\thinspace .
label{biot:strain:deform}
\end{equation}
!et
The parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ reflect elastic properties of the
medium and are called the *Lame* parameters. They can be related
to other widely used elastic parameters such as the Young's modulus,
Poisson's ratio, the bulk modulus, and the shear modulus. For example,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}, \quad\mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)},
\end{equation}
!et
where $E$ is Young's modulus and $\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.

Inserting (ref{biot:strain:deform}) in (ref{biot:effstress:strain})
and combining with (ref{biot:effective:stress}) gives

!bt
\begin{equation}
\stress  = \lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu\left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right) - \alpha p\,\I
label{biot:stress:strain}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
This equation together with
(ref{biot:solid:momentum}), neglecting
accelerations and restricting body forces to gravity only, are then
the two governing equations for elastic deformations in the skeleton.
We can easily substitute (ref{biot:stress:strain}) in
(ref{biot:solid:momentum}) to get one vector PDE for $\u$, but it
is coupled to the unknown fluid pressure $p$. Various specific models
are discussed later.

===== Fluid phase =====

The PDEs governing the fluid motion consists of a mass balance equation
and an average momentum equation famously known as Darcy's law.
The mass balance equation is

!bt
\begin{equation}
S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left(\bm{q} -
\alpha\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}\right) = 0,
label{biot:fluid:mass:balance}
\end{equation}
!et
where the first term models accumulation of fluid in a small volume,
while the other models the net outflow of the fluid from this
volume. In the latter
term, it is the relative velocity between the fluid ($\bm{q}$) and
the solid skeleton ($\partial\u/\partial t$) that is essential.
Darcy's law represents an average of the viscous fluid flow in a
large number of pores. As the pores are very small, the local Reynolds
number is small, and one can omit the inertia terms in the Navier-Stokes
equations.
# The viscous term ($\mu\varrho_f^{-1}\nabla^2\v$)
# is averaged to a term proportional to $\v$.
The resulting Darcy's laws relates the fluid velocity $\bm{q}$ to
the pressure and gravity forces:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{q} = - \frac{K}{\mu}(\nabla p - \varrho_f\bm{g})
label{biot:fluid:Darcy}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
The permeability $K$ models how easily a presure gradient can move
the fluid through the pores. Very often, especially in geological media,
the premeability is larger
in the horizontal directions than in the vertical direction, because
the medium has through the geological history been severely compacted
in the vertical direction due to gravity. When the permeability is
not equal in all space directions, one introduces a permeability tensor
and writes (ref{biot:fluid:Darcy}) as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{q} = \frac{\bm{K}}{\mu}\cdot(\nabla p - \varrho_f\bm{g})
label{biot:fluid:Darcy2}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
For example, a perfectly horizontal geological layer will have
$\bm{K}$ diagonal with $K_{xx}=K_{yy}$ equal to the horizontal
permeability and $K_{zz}$ as the vertical permeability (usually much
smaller than $K_{xx}=K_{yy}$).

We realize that (ref{biot:fluid:Darcy}) or (ref{biot:fluid:Darcy2})
can be substituted in (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}) to yield a
diffusion-like PDE for $p$, but this PDE is coupled to the displacement
$\u$ through the term $\alpha(\nabla\cdot\u)_t$. Specific forms of
the diffusion PDE for $p$ are given later.

The parameter $S$ is known as the *fluid storage coefficient*
and measures how much more fluid volume that can be stored in the porous
medium when the pressure increases. The $S$ parameter can be related
to the porosity
and the compressibility of the fluid and solid through

!bt
\begin{equation}
S = \frac{\phi}{k_f} + \frac{\alpha - \phi}{k_s},
\end{equation}
!et
where $\phi$ is the porosity (the fraction of fluid per unit volume
of the medium),

!bt
\begin{equation*}  k_f = \varrho_f\frac{\partial p}{\partial\varrho_f},\end{equation*}
!et
is the bulk modulus of the fluid,
and $k_s=\lambda + \frac{2}{3}\mu$ is the bulk modulus of the solid.
Frequently, the fluid is considered incompressible and then
$k_f\rightarrow\infty$.
The Biot-Willis coefficient $\alpha$ is closely related to the
bulk moduli,

!bt
\begin{equation*} \alpha \approx 1 - \frac{k_f}{k_s} \thinspace .\end{equation*}
!et
For an incompressible fluid, $S\approx (1-\phi)k_s^{-1}$. If also
the solid skeleton is incompressible, $S=0$.


===== Boundary conditions =====

For the solid, two types of boundary conditions are relevant: either
prescribed stress vector $\stress\cdot\normalvec$ or prescribed
displacement vector $\u$. At each point of the boundary, three scalar
conditions must be applied (two for 2D problems).
A combination of prescribed stress and deformation state
at a point is possible, for example, zero normal displacement
and zero shear stress. We let $\partial\Omega_{D,u}$ denote
the part of the boundary $\partial\Omega$
where $\u$ is known (Dirichlet conditions), and $\partial\Omega_{N,\sigma}$
is the part where the stress is known.

For the fluid, a scalar condition is needed at each point of the boundary.
Either $p$ has to be
prescribed or the normal flux $\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec$ must be known.
We let $\partial\Omega_{D,p}$ be the part of the boundary where
Dirichlet conditions ($p$ known) applies, and $\partial\Omega_{N,q}$
the part where the normal flux conditions are set.


===== Summary of key equations =====

The four key equations governing the mixture of a porous solid filled with
a fluid are then the momentum balance for the solid,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\stress = -\varrho_s\bm{g},
label{biot:solid:momentum:static}
\end{equation}
!et
the constitutive law for the solid (ref{biot:stress:strain}),
the mass balance equation (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}), and
Darcy's law. When speak about the *coupled problem*
when these four equations must be solved simultaneously.

Sometimes the velocity of the solid is small enough to justify dropping
the term $\alpha\nabla\cdot\u_t$ in (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}).
The result is that (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}) becomes independent
of $\u$, and we get an *uncoupled problem* where we first can
solve for $p$ and then for $\u$. The equation for $p$ arises from
eliminating $\bm{q}$ in (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}) with the aid of Darcy's
law:

!bt
\begin{equation}
S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} =
\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{K}{\mu}(\nabla p - \varrho_f\bm{g})\right)
label{biot:fluid:mass:balance2}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
The governing equation for $\u$ arises by inserting (ref{biot:stress:strain})
in (ref{biot:solid:momentum:static}):

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot \left(\lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu \left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right)\right) =
\alpha\nabla p -\varrho_s\bm{g}
label{biot:solid:momentum:u2}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et


===== Variational formulation of the decoupled problem =====

We now consider discretizing the decoupled problem where
the $p$ equation (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance2}) can be solved
independently of the $\u$ equation (ref{biot:solid:momentum:u2}).

The discretization of (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance2}) can be done
either prior to the variational formulation or after.
Here we perform the variational formulation first. Let $v^{(p)}\in V^{(p)}$
be a test function in the function space $V^{(p)}$. This is the space where
we seek $p$, or more precisely, $p-p_0$, where $p_0$ is a function
to model nonzero Dirichlet conditions on $\partial\Omega_{D,p}$.
Formally, $v^{(p)}=0$ on $\partial\Omega_{D,p}$, but in practice this condition
and $p_0$ are dropped and other methods used to enforce Dirichlet
conditions in finite element impelementations.

The derivation of a variational formulation follows the usual steps
of multiplying the governing equation by the test function and integrate
second-order derivatives, or more precisely, all the divergence terms,
by parts. The result becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \left( S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}v^{(p)} +
\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}
- \varrho_f\bm{g}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx = 0
\thinspace .
label{biot:fluid:mass:balance2:vf}
\end{equation}
!et

Introducing a Backward Euler scheme in time, and letting $p$ now denote
the fluid pressure at the new time level and $p_1$ the pressure at
the previous time level, we can write (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance2:vf})
as

!bt
\begin{align}
 & \int_\Omega \left( Spv^{(p)} +
\Delta t\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx =
\int_\Omega \left(Sp_1 - \Delta t\varrho_f\bm{g}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx
\nonumber\\
 & + \int_{\partial\Omega_{N,q}}\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec\,v^{(p)}\ds,
\ \forall v^{(p)}\in V^{(p)},
label{biot:fluid:mass:balance2:vf2}
\end{align}
!et
where $\Delta t$ is the time step, and we have placed all unknown terms
on the left-hand side.

For the variational formulation of the elasticity problem for $\u$, we
introduce a test vector function $\v^{(u)}\in V^{(u)}$. The space ${V^{(u)}}$ is
where we seek $\u$ (or more precisely, the part of $\u$ with
vanishing Dirichlet conditions). We require, formally, $\v^{(u)} =0$ at
$\partial\Omega_{D,u}$.
The variational formulation is
most easily derived by taking the inner product of $\v^{(u)}$ and
the original equation $\nabla\cdot\stress =-\varrho_s\bm{g}$,
and integrating by parts:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \stress : \nabla\v^{(u)}\dx = \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}
\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds
-\int_\Omega \varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)}\dx,\quad\forall\v^{(u)}\in{V^{(u)}}
label{biot:solid:momentum:static:vf0}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
The surface integral contains the normal stress
$\stress\cdot\normalvec$, which is prescribed on $\partial\Omega_{N,\sigma}$
(mixed stress and displacement conditions at the same boundary point
makes this a bit more complicated).

Since one can show that

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\stress :\nabla\v^{(u)} = \stress : \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\v^{(u)} + (\nabla\v^{(u)})^T),
\end{equation*}
!et
it is common to use the latter inner tensor product instead. That form
is what naturally arises when
deriving the variational form from the principle of minimum potential
elastic energy. Nevertheless, we use the notationally more compact
for $\stress :\nabla\v^{(u)}$ in the following.


Inserting the constitutive law (ref{biot:stress:strain}) in
(ref{biot:solid:momentum:static:vf0}) yields the final
variational form for the deformation problem:

!bt
\begin{align}
& \int_\Omega \left(
\lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu \left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right)\right) :
\nabla\v^{(u)}\dx = \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}
\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds\nonumber\\
 & -\int_\Omega \left(\varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)} - \alpha p \nabla\cdot\v^{(u)}\right) \dx,\ \forall\v^{(u)}\in{V^{(u)}}\thinspace .
label{biot:solid:momentum:static:vf}
\end{align}
!et


Variational formulations of linear problems are often expressed in an
abstract form $a(\cdot,\cdot)=L(\cdot)$. Here the abstract notation reads

!bt
\begin{align*}
a_p(p, v^{(p)}) &= L(v^{(p)}),\quad\forall v^{(p)}\in V^{(p)},\\
a_u(\u, \v^{(u)}) &= L(\v^{(u)}), \quad\forall \v^{(u)}\in V^{(u)}
\end{align*}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{align*}
a_p(p, v^{(p)}) &=
\int_\Omega \left( Spv^{(p)} +
\Delta t\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx,\\
L(v^{(p)}) &=\int_\Omega \left(Sp_1 - \Delta t\varrho_f\bm{g}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx
+ \int_{\partial\Omega_{N,q}}\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec\,v^{(p)}\ds,\\
a_u(\u, \v^{(u)}) &= \int_\Omega \stress : \nabla\v^{(u)}\dx = \int_\Omega \left(
\lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu \left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right)\right) :
\nabla\v^{(u)}\dx ,\\
L(\v^{(u)}) &= \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}
\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds
-\int_\Omega \left(\varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)} - \alpha p \nabla\cdot\v^{(u)}\right) \dx\thinspace .
\end{align*}
!et


===== Variational formulation of the coupled problem =====

For the coupled problem we introduce the test functions $v^{(p)}\in V^{(p)}$ and
$\v^{(u)}\in{V^{(u)}}$, which can be collected in a vector $(v^{(p)},\v^{(u)})
\in V^{(p)}\times V^{(u)}$.
By introducing ${\cal L}_p=0$ for the flow
PDE (ref{biot:fluid:mass:balance}) and ${\cal L}_{u}=0$ for
the deformation PDE
(ref{biot:solid:momentum:static}), we take the inner product
of $({\cal L}_p$, ${\cal L}_{u}$ and $(v^{(p)},\v^{(u)})$ and integrate over $\Omega$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \left( {\cal L}_p v^{(p)} + {\cal L}_{u} \cdot\v^{(u)}\right)\dx = 0
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et
We realize that the various terms involved in the integral equal those
in the uncoupled problem, modulo the term $\alpha\nabla\cdot\u_t$ that was not
present in the uncoupled problem. All divergence terms are integrated
by parts. We can also introduce a Backward Euler scheme to
discretize $p_t$ and $\nabla\cdot\u_t$ as done in the uncoupled problem.
The variational form becomes

!bt
\begin{align}
&\int_\Omega \left( Spv^{(p)} +
\Delta t\bm{q}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx -
\int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u\dx
\int_\Omega Sp_1\dx - \nonumber\\
&\int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u_1 \dx -
\int_{\partial\Omega_{N,q}}\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec\,v^{(p)}\ds +
\int_\Omega \stress : \nabla\v^{(u)}\dx - \nonumber\\
&\int_\Omega \left(\varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)} - \alpha p \nabla\cdot\v^{(u)}\right) \dx
- \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds,\nonumber\\
& \qquad\qquad \forall (v^{(p)},\v^{(u)})\in V^{(p)}\times{V^{(u)}},
label{biot:coupled:fv}
\end{align}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{q} = - \frac{K}{\mu}(\nabla p - \varrho_f\bm{g}),
\end{equation}
!et
or

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{q} = - \frac{\bm{K}}{\mu}(\nabla p - \varrho_f\bm{g}),
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation}
\stress  = \lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu\left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right) - \alpha p\,\I
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
!et

It is easy in FEniCS implementations to work with mathematical relations
between mathematical quantities entering variational form, so
(ref{biot:coupled:fv}) is a convenient way to state the variational
form, with the $p$-$\bm{q}$ and $\stress$-$\u$ relations available for
substitution into the form. For mathematical writing it is common
to perform such substitutions directly in the form:

!bt
\begin{align}
& \int_\Omega \left( Spv^{(p)} +
\Delta t\frac{K}{\mu}\nabla p\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx -
\int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u\dx - \nonumber\\
&\int_\Omega \left(Sp_1 - \Delta t\varrho_f\bm{g}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx
- \int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u_1 \dx - \int_{\partial\Omega_{N,q}}\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec\,v^{(p)}\ds +
\nonumber\\
& \int_\Omega
\lambda \nabla\cdot\u\,\I +
\mu \left(\nabla\u + (\nabla \u)^T\right) : \nabla\v^{(u)}\dx - \nonumber\\
&\int_\Omega \left(\varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)} - \alpha p \nabla\cdot\v^{(u)}\right) \dx
- \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}
\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds,\nonumber\\
& \qquad\qquad \forall (v^{(p)},\v^{(u)})\in V^{(p)}\times{V^{(u)}}
\thinspace .
\end{align}
!et

An abstract variational form of the coupled problem can be written as

!bt
\begin{equation*} a((p,\u), (v^{(p)}, \v^{(u)})) = L((v^{(p)}, \v^{(u)})),\end{equation*}
!et
with

!bt
\begin{align*}
a((p,\u), (v^{(p)}, \v^{(u)}))
&= \int_\Omega \left( Spv^{(p)} +
\Delta t\bm{q}\cdot\nabla v^{(p)}\right)\dx -
\int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u\dx +\\
&\quad \int_\Omega \stress : \nabla\v^{(u)}\dx + \\
L((v^{(p)}, \v^{(u)})) &=
\int_\Omega Sp_1\dx - \int_\Omega \alpha \nabla v^{(p)}\cdot\u_1 \dx -
\int_{\partial\Omega_{N,q}}\bm{q}\cdot\normalvec\,v^{(p)}\ds +\\
&\quad \int_\Omega \left(\varrho_s\bm{g}\cdot\v^{(u)}
- \alpha p \nabla\cdot\v^{(u)}\right) \dx
- \int_{\Omega_{N,\sigma}}\v^{(u)}\cdot\stress\cdot\normalvec \ds
\thinspace .
\end{align*}
!et


===== Reductions =====

Familiar equations: diffusion, Laplace, std elasticity, thermo-elasticity.

======= Appendix: Derivations =======

For now this is just a rough copy of the MekIT'13 paper. Note that
the derivation is for incompressible media while the equations above
are for compressible too.

===== Poroelasticity versus Porous Media Theory =====

There are two different theories in use today, which both describe
wave propagation in porous materials. The first is
\textit{poroelasticity}, also known as Biot's theory, which builds on
the work by Terzaghi. The second is the \textit{theory of porous
  media}, which is derived from first principles in mechanics. The
main difference between these theories lies in the way the solid-fluid
interaction is handled. However, it turns out that for individually
incompressible fluid and solid phase, the two approaches are identical
as long as we assume that all pores are interconnected and that there
is no exchange of mass (see cite{Schanz2003}).

The fluid phase, consisting of the interstitial fluid, is a water-like
incompressible fluid. The solid phase also contains a large amount of
water and is nearly incompressible. The only problem with assuming an
incompressible solid phase is that in the current approach the
vasculature is part of the solid. The vasculature is compressible and
expands during systole. However, since it only accounts for 3\
# of the
total volume the errors we make is relatively small. In the following
we will derive the equations from first principles based on
cite{Has80} and cite{Schanz2003}.

# ===== Mathematical Model =====
===== Momentum balance =====

To set up a balance of forces in a porous medium, both the fluid and
the solid phase have to be considered.  To distinguish between the
fluid and solid components the subscript $f$ and $s$ are used
respectively. For the fluid phase we have the momentum balance
equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \int_V \phi\rho_f\frac{D\bm{v}_f}{Dt} \text{d} V = \int_V
 \phi\rho_f\bm{g}\text{d} V + \int_S \bm{n}\cdot(\phi\bm{T}_f)
 \text{d}S + \int_V\bm{F}_{fs} \text{d} V label{eq:int_mom_s}
\end{equation}
!et
and for the solid phase

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \int_V (1-\phi)\rho_s\frac{D\bm{v}_s}{Dt} \text{d}
 V = \int_V (1-\phi)\rho_s\bm{g} \text{d} V- \int_S \bm{n}
\cdot\left((1-\phi)\bm{T}_s\right)\text{d}S + \int_V \bm{F}_{sf}
 \text{d} V. label{eq:in_mom_f}
\end{equation}
!et
The porosity $\phi$ enters the integrals since we are to integrate
over the fluid or the solid, and the fluid occupies a fraction $\phi$
of the volume or surface, while the solid occupies the remaining
fraction $1-\phi$.
From the integral balance equations above we apply Gauss' theorem to the
surface integrals and derive the corresponding partial differential
equations

!bt
\begin{align}
 \phi\rho_f\frac{D\bm{v}_f}{Dt} &= \phi\rho_f\bm{g} +
 \nabla\cdot(\phi\bm{T}_f) +
 \bm{F}_{fs} label{eq:mom_s}\\
(1-\phi)\rho_s\frac{D\bm{v}_s}{Dt}
&= (1-\phi)\rho_s\bm{g} -
 \nabla\cdot\left((1-\phi)\bm{T}_s\right) +
 \bm{F}_{sf} label{eq:mom_f}
\end{align}
!et
with $\bm{v}$ as velocities, $\rho$ partial densities, $\phi$ porosity,
and $\bm{T}$ the stress tensors.
The operator $\frac{D}{Dt}$ denotes the material
time derivative following either a fluid or solid particle (depending on
the equation).
The gravity force is given by $\bm{g}$ term, but
will be neglected in the following. The friction force between
the fluid and solid phase are represented by $\bm{F}_{sf}$ and $\bm{F_{fs}}$
and according to Newton's 3rd law these forces cancel each
other out.

Adding
equations (ref{eq:mom_f}) and (ref{eq:mom_s}), neglecting
acceleration of the fluid and gravity forces result in the momentum
balance for the fluid-solid mixture

!bt
\begin{equation}
 (1-\phi)\rho_s\frac{D\bm{v}_s}{Dt} = -
  \nabla\cdot\left((1-\phi)\bm{T}_s
  +\phi\bm{T}_f\right). label{eq:mom_mix}
\end{equation}
!et
For the fluid phase the stress tensor is governed by the hydrostatic
pressure and reduces to $\bm{T}_f = -p\bm{I}$. That is, the extra
stress $\bm{\sigma}^E_f$ due to viscous forces are negligible in the
divergence term, but the friction between the fluid and solid because
of viscous effects is substantial. However, this effect must be
averaged and is modeled by the exchange terms $\mathbf{F}_{sf}$ and
$\mathbf{F}_{fs}$. For the solid phase we need to take the internal
stresses $\bm{\sigma}^E_s$ into account and set $\bm{T}_s =
\bm{\sigma}_E - p\bm{I}$. Now the total stress tensor is given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \bm{T}_{T} = (1-\phi)\bm{T}_s + \phi\bm{T}_f =
 (1-\phi)(\bm{\sigma}^E_s - p\bm{I}) - \phi p \mathbf{I} \approx
 \bm{\sigma} - p\mathbf{I}.
\end{equation}
!et

For linear elasticity the displacement vector
$\bm{u}$ can be related to strain tensor field,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{e} = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\bm{u} + \nabla^T\bm{u}).
label{eq:strain}
\end{equation}
!et
Assuming an isotropic, linear elastic medium, it can be shown that the
following linear stress-strain relation holds:

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\bm{\sigma} = 2\mu\bm{e} + \lambda (\mbox{tr} \bm{e}) \bm{I}
        label{eq:stress}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\mu$ and $\lambda$ represent Lam\'e parameters.

For small deformations,

!bt
\begin{equation*} \frac{D\bm{v}_s}{Dt} \approx \frac{\partial^2\bm{u}}{\partial^2 t}. \end{equation*}
!et
Substituting (ref{eq:stress}) and (ref{eq:strain})
into (ref{eq:mom_mix}) and rearranging yields:

!bt
\begin{equation}
	 (1-\phi)\rho_s\frac{\partial^2\bm{u}}{\partial^2 t} =
          \nabla\cdot\left(\mu(\nabla\bm{u} + \nabla^T\bm{u})
        +\lambda(\nabla\cdot\bm{u})\bm{I}\right) -\nabla p
         label{eq:momentum2}
\end{equation}
!et
It is common to neglect the acceleration term on the left-hand side when
we do not want to include fast sound waves in the model. From now on
we therefore omit this term.

# Note that $\mathbf{u}$ and $p$ are time-dependent due to Eq. (_PROBLEM: EXTERNAL REF_) ref{eq:13}.
The Lam\'e parameters are used to characterize the elasticity of a
medium and are related to the Poisson ratio $\nu$ and Young's
modulus $E$ as follows:

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\qquad\lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)},\qquad\mu =
        \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)} label{eq:lambdamu}
\end{equation}
!et
High values of $\mu$ and $\lambda$ implies a stiff material.

===== Volume balance =====

Assuming the density of the solid and the fluid phase to be constant
the mass balance can be transformed to a volume balance:
# (see e.g. \citet{Hel97}):
For the solid phase we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\frac {\partial(1-\phi)}{\partial t} label{eq:volSol} +
        \nabla\cdot\left((1-\phi)\cdot\bm{v}_s\right) = 0
\end{equation}
!et
and for the fluid phase we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\frac {\partial\phi}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\phi\bm{v}_f)
        label{eq:volFluid} \pm \Omega_F(\bm{x}, t) = 0.
\end{equation}
!et
# Here $\mathbf v_s$ and $\mathbf v_f$ represent the velocities of the solid and fluid phases, respectively. $\phi$ is porosity and $\mathit \Omega_F(\mathbf x, t)$ denotes source/sink terms of the fluid phase.
Adding (ref{eq:volSol}) and (ref{eq:volFluid}) yields:

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\nabla\cdot\left(\phi\bm{v}_f+(1-\phi)\bm{v}_s\right)
        label{eq:volMix} \pm \mathit \Omega_F(\bm{x}, t) = 0
\end{equation}
!et
In the case of infinitesimal deformation,

!bt
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf v_s = \frac {\partial\bm{u}}{\partial t} label{eq:velSol}
\end{equation}
!et
The fluid velocity $\bm{v}_f$ can be
derived from the momentum balance of the fluid
(ref{eq:mom_f}), and again by neglecting acceleration of
the fluid we obtain

!bt
\begin{equation}
 -\nabla\cdot(\phi p \bm{I}) + \bm{F}_{fs} = 0 label{eq:mom_f2}
\end{equation}
!et
#  KHS: This is the explanation I found: "In a heterogeneous medium
#    the forces exerted on the solid from the fluid are smaller in the
#    areas with low porosity than in areas with high porosity, to balance
#    the forces there has to be a force in the direction from lower to
#    higher porosity. This force prevents the fluid from flowing due to
#    porosity gradients. Further, we assume that the average drag of the
#    solid on the fluid is dependent on the difference between the solid
#    and the fluid phase velocity $T(v_f - v_s)$"}
As mentioned, $\bm{F}_{sf}$ represents the friction forces between
the solid and fluid
phases, which is modeled by the linear relation:

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \bm{F}_{sf} = p\nabla \phi - \bm{R}(\bm{v}_f - \bm{v}_s) label{eq:F_sf}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\bm{R}$ is a second order tensor arising in the linearization
of $\bm{F}_{sf}$.  Replacing $\bm{F}_{sf}$ in (ref{eq:mom_f2})
yields

!bt
\begin{align}
 -\nabla\cdot(\phi p \bm{I}) + p\nabla \phi - \bm{R} (\bm{v}_f -
\bm{v}_s) &= 0 \\ \bm{v}_f &= -\phi \bm{R}^{-1} \nabla p + \bm{v}_s label{eq:vel_f}
\end{align}
!et
Finally, $\bm{R}$ can be related to the conductivity of the porous
medium cite{Has80}

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \bm{R}^{-1} := \frac{\bm{K}}{\mu_w\phi}.
\end{equation}
!et

Substituting (ref{eq:velSol}) and (ref{eq:vel_f}) in
(ref{eq:volMix}) and rearranging yields the final form of
the fluid-solid mixture volume balance:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \left( \frac {\partial \bm{u}} {\partial t} -\frac
       {\bm{K}}{\mu_w} \nabla p\right) = \mathit \Omega_F(\bm{x},
       t) label{eq:volBal}
\end{equation}
!et
