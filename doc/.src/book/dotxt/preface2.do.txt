It is now three years since Hans Petter asked me to help him finalize this book on finite 
element methods. This book is also in many ways similar to Hans Petter's first book 
on finite element methods and the software library Diffpack - the first book that
I read about finite element methods in the late ninties and it was precious to me
for many years. In particular, it combined interesting mathematics and skillfull
programming with detailed examples that one could play around with to learn.     
The Diffpack book had widespread influence as can be seen in many of today's
finite element packages. 

A lot has changed since the ninties: There are many powerful and successful
open source packages for finite elements in particular and scientific computing
in general. Students today are not expected to develop code from scratch, but rather
to use and combine the tools out there. The programming enviroment is also different
at first glance, e.g., by a user-friendly Python interface. However, the advanced
and hybrid programming paradigm that enable such user-friendly scripting also 
poses challenges as there are many layers of code in different languages that
combine both languages, code generation and symbolic and numerical mathematics.    
As such, there is for teaching material that explore the possibilities of these new tools. 
 
This book is born out of a desire to explain the powerful combination of explicit mathematics
where symbolic and numerical approaches are combined. Furthermore, the aim is to provide
all details, although only in simplifed examples. Finally, Hans Petter always wanted to lower
the bar for introducing finite elements by avoiding the theoretical issues with Sobolev spaces etc.   

========= Acknowledgement =========
Many people have helped with this book over the years as it evolved from the Diffpack book to 
the current book which is very very different. Unfortuntately, I did not discuss this process
with Hans Petter and neither did we discuss the acknowledgedment on his behalf.  

Johannes Ring and  Kristian Hustad have helped with many technical issues regarding DocOnce.  
I have received comments, advice and corrections from  Yapi Achou, Svein Linge, Matthew Moelter, and  Murilo Moreira.   

Finally, I would like to thank Nancy, Natalie and Niklas for their support and for providing excellent 
working conditions during the writing of this book.
