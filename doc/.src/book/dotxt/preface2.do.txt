========= Second Preface =========
It is now three years since Hans Petter asked me to help him finalize this book on finite 
element methods. 
Obviously, I was honored, but also aware that this would be a significant commitment. 
That said, it did not take me long to decide.
The reason was that the first book I read about finite element methods, in the late nineties,  was Hans Petter's first book about 
finite elements and the software library Diffpack. 
His book was precious to me for many years. In particular, it combined interesting mathematics and skillful
programming with detailed examples that one could play around with to learn.     
The Diffpack book had widespread influence as can be seen in many of today's
finite element packages, FEniCS being one example.

This book is also in many ways similar to Hans Petter's first book.  
However, a lot has changed since the nineties: There are many powerful and successful
open source packages for finite elements in particular and scientific computing
in general that are available. Hence, students today are not expected to develop their codes from scratch, but rather
to use and combine the tools out there. The programming environment is also different
from what it was in the 90s. Python was then an obscure language then but is now
the dominating language in scientific computing which almost all packages provide an interface to, even though 
computationally intensive parts are written in FORTRAN/C/C++.   
However, the advanced
and hybrid programming paradigm that enable such user-friendly scripting also 
poses challenges as there are many layers of code in different languages that
combine both languages, code generation and symbolic and numerical mathematics.    
As such, there is a for teaching material that 
expose the internals of a finite element engine and allow for scrutinous investigation 
in a clean environment. In particular, Hans Petter always wanted to lower
the bar for introducing finite elements by avoiding the theoretical issues with Sobolev spaces etc.   

*Acknowledgement*
Many people have helped with this book over the years as it evolved. Unfortunately, I did not discuss this process
with Hans Petter and neither did we discuss the acknowledgement on his behalf.  

Johannes Ring and  Kristian Hustad have helped with many technical issues regarding DocOnce.  
I have received comments, advice and corrections from  Yapi Achou, Svein Linge, Matthew Moelter, and  Murilo Moreira.   

Finally, I would like to thank Nancy, Natalie and Niklas for their support and for providing excellent 
working conditions during the writing of this book.
