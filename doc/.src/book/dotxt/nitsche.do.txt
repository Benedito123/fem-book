======= Optimization with constraint =======
label{nitsche:fxy:opt}

Suppose we have a function

!bt
\[ f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \tp\]
!et
and want to optimize its values, i.e., find minima and maxima.
The condition for an optimum is that the derivatives vanish in all
directions, which implies

!bt
\[ \bm{n}\cdot\nabla f = 0\quad\forall\bm{n} \in \Real^2,\]
!et
which further implies
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0,\quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0\tp
\]
!et
These two equations are in general nonlinear and can have many solutions,
one unique solution, or none.
In our specific example, there is only one solution: $x=0$, $y=0$.

Now we want to optimize $f(x,y)$ under the constraint $y=2-x$.
This means that only $f$ values along the line $y=2-x$ are relevant,
and we can imagine we view $f(x,y)$ along this line and want to find
the the optimum value.

===== Elimination of variables =====

Our $f$ is obviously a function one variable along the line.
Inserting $y=2-x$ in $f(x,y)$ eliminates $y$ and leads to $f$ as
function of $x$ alone:

!bt
\[ f(x,y=2-x) = 4 - 4x + 2x^2\tp\]
!et
The condition for an optimum is

!bt
\[ \frac{d}{dx}(4 - 4x + 2x^2) = -4 + 4x = 0,\]
!et
so $x=1$ and $y=2-x=1$.

In the general case we have a scalar function $f(\x)$,
$\x=(x_0,\ldots,x_m)$ with $n+1$ constraints $g_i(\x)=0$,
$i=0,\ldots,n$. In theory, we could use the constraints to
express $n+1$ variables in terms of the remaining $m-n$ variables,
but this very seldom possible, because it requires us to solve
the $g_i=0$ symbolically with respect to $n+1$ different variables.

===== Lagrange multiplier method =====
label{nitsche:fxy:opt:Lagrange}

When we cannot easily eliminate variables using the constraint(s),
the Lagrange multiplier method come to aid. Optimization of $f(x,y)$
under the constraint $g(x,y)=0$ then consists in formulating
the *Lagrangian*

!bt
\[ \ell(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y) + \lambda g(x,y),\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier, which is unknown.
The conditions for an optimum is that

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\ell}{\partial x}=0,\quad
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial y}=0,\quad
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial \lambda}=0\tp\]
!et
In our example, we have

!bt
\[ \ell(x,y,\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + \lambda(y - 2 + x),\]
!et
leading to the conditions

!bt
\[ 2x + \lambda = 0,\quad 2y + \lambda = 0,\quad y - 2+ x = 0\tp\]
!et
This is a system of three linear equations in three unknowns with
the solution

!bt
\[ x = 1,\quad y = 1,\quad \lambda =2\tp\]
!et

In the general case with optimizing $f(\x)$ subject to
the constraints $g_i(\x)=0$, $i=0,\ldots,n$, the Lagrangian becomes

!bt
\[ \ell(\x,\bm{\lambda}) = f(\x) + \sum_{j=0}^n\lambda_jg_j(\x),\]
!et
with $\x=(x_0,\ldots,x_m)$ and $\bm{\lambda}=(\lambda_0,\ldots,\lambda_n)$.
The conditions for an optimum are

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial\x}=0,\quad
\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bm{\lambda}}=0\tp,\]
!et
where
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial\x}=0\Rightarrow
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}=0,\ i=0,\ldots,m\tp\]
!et
Similarly, $\partial f/\partial\bm{\lambda}=0$ leads to
$n+1$ equations $\partial f/\partial\lambda_i=0$, $i=0,\ldots,n$.

===== Penalty method =====
label{nitsche:fxy:opt:penalty}

Instead of incorporating the constraint exactly, as in the
Lagrange multiplier method, the penalty method employs an approximation
at the benefit of avoiding the extra Lagrange multiplier as unknown.
The idea is to add the constraint squared, multiplied by a large
prescribed number $\lambda$, called the penalty parameter,

!bt
\[ \ell_\lambda (x,y) = f(x,y) + \frac{1}{2}\lambda(y-2+x)^2\tp\]
!et
Note that $\lambda$ is now a given (chosen) number.
The $\ell_\lambda$ function is just a function of two variables,
so the optimum is found
by solving

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial \ell_\lambda}{\partial x} =0,\quad
\frac{\partial \ell_\lambda}{\partial y} =0\tp\]
!et
Here we get

!bt
\[ 2x +\lambda (y-2+x)=0,\quad
2y + \lambda (y-2+x)=0\tp\]
!et
The solution becomes

!bt
\[ x = y = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{-1}},\]
!et
which we see approaches the correct solution $x=y=1$
as $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$.

The penalty method for optimization of a multi-variate function
$f(\x)$ with constraints $g_i(\x)=0$, $i=0,\ldots,n$,
can be formulated as optimization of the unconstrained function

!bt
\[ \ell_\lambda(\x) = f(\x) + \frac{1}{2}\lambda\sum_{j=0}^n (g_i(\x))^2\tp\]
!et
Sometimes the symbol $\epsilon^{-1}$ is used for $\lambda$ in the
penalty method.

======= Optimization of functionals =======
label{nitsche:pde:opt}

The methods above for optimization of scalar functions of a finite
number of variables can be generalized to optimization of
functionals (functions of functions).
We start with the specific example of optimizing

!bt
\begin{equation} F(u) =
\int\limits_\Omega ||\nabla u||^2 \dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fu \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}gu \ds,\quad
u\in V,
label{nitsche:Fu:functional1}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\Omega\subset \Real^2$, and $u$ and $f$ are functions of $x$
and $y$ in $\Omega$. The norm $||\nabla u||^2$ is defined as $u_{x}^2
+ u_{y}^2$, with $u_x$ denoting the derivative with respect to $x$.
The vector space $V$ contains the relevant functions for this problem,
and more specifically, $V$ is the Hilbert space $H^1_0$ consisting of
all functions for which $\int\limits_\Omega (u^2 + ||\nabla u||^2)\dx$
is finite and $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega_D$, which is some part of the
boundary $\partial\Omega$ of $\Omega$.  The remaining part of the
boundary is denoted by $\partial\Omega_N$
($\partial\Omega_N\cup\partial\Omega_D=\partial\Omega$,
$\partial\Omega_N\cap\partial\Omega_D=\emptyset$), over which $F(u)$
involves a line integral.  Note that $F$ is a mapping from any $u\in
V$ to a real number in $\Real$.

===== Classical calculus of variations =====
label{nitsche:pde:opt:varcalculus}

Optimization of the functional
$F$ makes use of the machinery from "variational calculus": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_calculus". The essence is to demand that the
functional derivative of $F$ with respect to $u$ is zero.
Technically, this is carried out by writing a general function $\tilde u\in V$
as $\tilde u=u+\epsilon v$, where $u$ is the exact solution of the optimization
problem, $v$ is an arbitrary function in $V$,
and $\epsilon$ is a scalar parameter. The
functional derivative in the direction of $v$ (also known as the
"Gateaux derivative": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A2teaux_derivative")
is defined as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta u} = \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{d}{d\epsilon}
F(u+\epsilon v)
\tp
label{nitcshe:functional:derivative}
\end{equation}
!et

As an example,
the functional derivative to the term
$\int\limits_\Omega fu\dx$ in $F(u)$
is computed by finding

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int\limits_\Omega f\cdot(u+\epsilon v)\dx
= \int\limits_\Omega fv \dx,
label{nitcshe:varform:Poisson1}
\end{equation}
!et
and then let $\epsilon$ go to zero, which just results in $\int\limits_\Omega fv\dx$.
The functional derivative of the other area integral becomes

!bt
\[
\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int\limits_\Omega ((u_x + \epsilon v_x)^2 +
(u_y + \epsilon v_y)^2)\dx = \int\limits_\Omega (2(u_x + \epsilon v_x)v_x
+ 2(u_v+\epsilon v_y)v_y)\dx,
\]
!et
which leads to

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_\Omega (u_xv_x + u_yv_y)\dx = \int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx,
label{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2}
\end{equation}
!et
as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$.

The functional derivative of the boundary term
becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\epsilon} \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\uN \cdot (u+\epsilon v) \ds
= \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\uN v \ds,
label{nitcshe:varform:Poisson3}
\end{equation}
!et
for any $\epsilon$. From (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson1})-(ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson3}) we then get the result

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta u} =
\int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fv \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\uN v \ds =0\tp
label{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}
\end{equation}
!et
Since $v$ is arbitrary, this equation must hold $\forall v\in V$. Many
will recognize (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}) as the variational
formulation of a Poisson problem, which can be directly discretized
and solved by a finite element method.

Variational calculus goes one more step and derives a partial differential
equation problem from (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}), known as the
"Euler-Lagrange equation": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler-Lagrange_equation" corresponding to optimization of $F(u)$. To find the differential
equation, one manipulates the variational form
(ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}) such that no derivatives of $v$
appear and the equation (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}) can be
written as $\int\limits_\Omega \mathcal{L}v\dx =0$, $\forall v\in$, from which
it follows that $\mathcal{L}=0$ is the differential equation.

Performing integration by parts of the term
$\int\limits_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx$ in (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson})
moves the derivatives of $v$ over to $u$:

!bt
\begin{align*}
 \int\limits_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx &=
-\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx + \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds\\
& = -\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_D}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds\\
& = -\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_D}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}0 \ds +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds\\
& = -\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds\tp
\end{align*}
!et
Using this rewrite in (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson}) gives

!bt
\[
-\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds
-\int\limits_\Omega fv\dx
-\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\uN v, \ds
\]
!et
which equals

!bt
\[\int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u + f)v\dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}-g\right)vds
=0\tp
\]
!et
This is to hold for any $v\in V$, which means that the integrands
must vanish, and we get the famous Poisson problem

!bt
\begin{align*}
-\nabla^2u &= f,\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,\\
u &=0,\quad (x,y)\in\partial\Omega_D,\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &=g,\quad (x,y)\in\partial\Omega_N\tp
\end{align*}
!et

!bnotice Some remarks.
 * Specifying $u$ on some part of the boundary ($\partial\Omega_D$)
   implies a specification of $\partial u/\partial n$ on the rest
   of the boundary. In particular, if such a specification is not
   explicitly done, the mathematics above implies $\partial u/\partial n=0$
   on $\partial\Omega_N$.
 * If a non-zero condition on $u=u_0$ on $\partial\Omega_D$ is wanted, one
   can write $u = u_0 + \bar u$ and express the functional
   $F$ in terms of $\bar u$, which obviously must vanish on
   $\partial\Omega_D$ since $u$ is the exact solution that is $u_0$
   on $\partial\Omega_D$.
 * The boundary conditions on $u$ must be implemented in the space $V$,
   i.e., we can only work with functions that *must* be zero on
   $\partial\Omega_D$ (so-called *essential boundary condition*).
   The condition involving $\partial u/\partial n$ is easier to
   implement since it is just a matter of computing a line integral.
 * The solution is not unique if $\partial\Omega_E = \emptyset$
   (any solution $u+\hbox{const}$ is also a solution).

===== Penalty method for optimization with constraints =====
label{nitsche:pde:opt:penalty}

The attention is now on optimization of a functional $F(u)$
with a given constraint that $u=\uN$ on $\partial\Omega_N$.
We could, of course, just extend the condition on $u$ in the
previous set-up by saying that $\partial\Omega_D$ is the
complete boundary $\partial\Omega$ and that $u$ takes on
the values of $0$ and $\uN$ at the different parts of the
boundary. However, this also implies that all the functions
in $V$ must vanish on the entire boundary. We want to relax
this condition (and by relaxing it, we will derive a method
that can be used for many other types of boundary conditions!).
The goal is, therefore, to incorporate $u=\uN$ on
$\partial\Omega_N$ without demanding anything from the functions
in $V$. We can achieve this by enforcing the constraint

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N} (u-\uN)\ds = 0\tp
label{nitsche:essbc:constraint}
\end{equation}
!et

__A penalty method.__
The idea is to add a penalization term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda(u-\uN)^2$,
integrated over the boundary $\partial\Omega_N$, to
the functional $F(u)$, just as we do in the penalty method (the
factor $\frac{1}{2}$ can be incorporated in $\lambda$, but makes the
final result look nicer).
The condition $\partial u/\partial n=g$
on $\partial\Omega_N$ is no longer relevant, so we replace
the $g$ by the unknown $\partial u/\partial n$ in the
boundary integral term in (ref{nitsche:Fu:functional1}).
The new functional becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} F(u) =
\int\limits_\Omega ||\nabla u||^2 \dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fu \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}gu \ds +
\frac{1}{2}\lambda\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}(u-\uN)^2 \ds,\quad
u\in V,
label{nitsche:Fu:functional2}
\end{equation}
!et
In $F(\tilde u)$, insert $\tilde u=u+\epsilon v$,
differentiate with respect
to $\epsilon$, and let $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$.
The result becomes

!bt
\begin{equation} \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} =
\int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fv \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda (u-\uN)v \ds
=0\tp
label{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2s}
\end{equation}
!et

!bnotice Remark.
We can drop the essential condition $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega_E$ and
just use the method above to enforce $u=\uN$ on the entire boundary
$\partial\Omega$.

#The formulation (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2s}) for incorporating
#boundary conditions weakly is due to Nitsche

__Symmetrization.__
Using the formulation (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2s}) for finite
element computations has one disadvantage: the variational form
is no longer symmetric, and the coefficient matrix in the associated
linear system becomes non-symmetric. We see this if we
rewrite (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2s}) as

!bt
\[ a(u,v) = L(v),\quad\forall v\in V,\]
!et
with

!bt
\begin{align*}
a(u,v) &=
\int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx
-\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds
+ \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda uv \ds,\\
L(v) &= \int\limits_\Omega fv \dx +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda \uN v \ds
\tp
\end{align*}
!et
The lack of symmetry is
evident in that we cannot interchange $u$ and $v$ in $a(u,v)$.
The standard finite element method has the symmetry property
in Poisson problems. The problematic non-symmetric term
is the line integral of $v\partial u/\partial n$.
If we had another term $u\partial v/\partial n$, the sum would be
symmetric. The idea is therefore to subtract $\int_{\partial\Omega_N}
u\partial v/\partial n\ds$ from both $a(u,v)$ and $L(v)$.
Since $u=\uN$ on $\partial\Omega_N$ we subtract
$\int_{\partial\Omega_N}
u\partial v/\partial n\ds = \int_{\partial\Omega_N}
\uN\partial v/\partial n\ds$ in $L(v)$:

!bt
\begin{align*}
a(u,v) &=
\int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla v \dx
-\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \ds
- \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}u \ds
+ \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda uv \ds,\\
L(v) &= \int\limits_\Omega fv \dx
- \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}\uN \ds
+ \int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda \uN v \ds
\tp
\end{align*}
!et
This formulation is known as Nitsche's method, but it is actually
a standard penalty method.

We can also easily derive this formulation from the partial differential
equation problem. We multiply $-\nabla^2 u=f$ by $v$ and integrate over
$\Omega$. Integration by parts leads to

!bt
\[ \int\limits_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v\dx =
-\int\limits_\Omega \nabla u\cdot \nabla v\dx
+ \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v\ds\tp
\]
!et
Now, $u=0$ and therefore $v=0$ on $\partial\Omega_D$ so the
line integral reduces to an integral over $\partial\Omega_N$, where
we have no condition and hence no value for $\partial u/\partial n$,
so we leave the integral as is.
Then we add the boundary penalization term $\lambda\int_{\partial\Omega_N}
(u-\uN)v\ds$. The result becomes identical to (ref{nitcshe:varform:Poisson2s}).
We can thereafter add the symmetrization terms if desired.

===== Lagrange multiplier method for optimization with constraints =====
label{nitsche:pde:opt:Lagrange}

We consider the same problem as in Section ref{nitsche:pde:opt:penalty},
but this time we want to apply a Lagrange multiplier method so we can
solve for a multiplier function* rather than specifying a large number for a
penalty parameter and getting an approximate result.

The functional to be optimized reads

!bt
\[
F(u) =
\int\limits_\Omega ||\nabla u||^2 \dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fu \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\uN \ds +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda(u-\uN)\ds,\quad
u\in V\tp
\]
!et
Here we have two unknown functions: $u\in V$ in $\Omega$ and $\lambda\in Q$ on
$\partial\Omega_N$. The optimization criteria are

!bt
\[ \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} = 0,\quad\frac{\delta F}{\delta\lambda} = 0\tp\]
!et
We write $\tilde u = u + \epsilon_u v$ and $\tilde\lambda = \lambda +
\epsilon_\lambda p$, where $v$ is an arbitrary function in $V$ and $p$ is an
arbitrary function in $Q$. We insert the expressions for $\tilde u$ and
$\tilde\lambda$ for $u$ and $\lambda$ and compute

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta u} &=
\lim_{\epsilon_u\rightarrow 0}\frac{dF}{d\epsilon_u} =
\int\limits_{\Omega}\nabla u\cdot\nabla v\dx -
\int\limits_\Omega fv \dx -
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v\ds  +
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N}\lambda(u-\uN)\ds = 0,\\
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \lambda} &=
\lim_{\epsilon_\lambda\rightarrow 0}\frac{dF}{d\epsilon_\lambda} =
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_N} \lambda(u-\uN) p\ds = 0
\end{align*}
!et


===== Example: 1D problem =====
label{nitsche:pde:opt:1Dex}

Let us do hand calculations to demonstrate weakly enforced boundary
conditions via a penalty method and via the Lagrange multiplier method.

We study the simple problem $-u'' = 2$ on $[0,1]$ with boundary
conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=1$. A uniform mesh with nodes
$x_i=i\Delta x$ is introduced, numbered from left to right:
$i=0,\ldots,N_x$. The approximate value of $u$ at $x_i$ is denoted
by $u_i$, and in general the approximation to $u$ is $\sum_{i=0}^{N_x}
\varphi_i(x)u_i$.

A standard finite element method
with linear Lagrange (P1) elements leads to the coupled linear equations

!bt
\[ \frac{1}{h}\left(-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1}\right) = 2,\]
!et
for $i=1,\ldots,N_x-1$, with $u_0=0$ and $u_{N_x}=1$. We may set
up a matrix system with all the parameters $u_0,\ldots,u_{N_x}$:

 * Set up matrix system explicitly.

Let us enforce both boundary
conditions weakly.
