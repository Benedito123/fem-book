Show how polynomial chaos fits right into the framework from the second
and third chapter.

We shall now look at *uncertainty analysis* of differential equations. We
assume that we have some function $u(\x,t;\zeta)$, where $\zeta$ is a
vector of *random variables* $(\zeta_0,\ldots,\zeta_N)$ that introduces
uncertainty in the problem. Note that the uncertainty is described by
$N+1$ stochastic parmeters and is therefore *discretized*. If we have
temporal or spatial stochastic processes or stochastic space-time fields,
these are continuous, and the mathematical formulations become considerably
more complicated. Assuming the uncertainty to be described by a set of
discrete stochastic *variables* represents the same simplification as we
introduced in earlier chapters where we assumed the solution to be
discrete, $u(\x)\approx\sum_ic_i\baspsi_i(\x)$, and worked with
variational forms in finite-dimensional spaces. We could, as briefly shown,
equally well worked with variational forms in *infinite-dimensional* spaces,
but the theory would involve Sobelov spaces rather than the far more
intuitive vector spaces. In the same manner, stochastic processes and fields
and their mathematical theory are avoided when assuming the uncertainty to
be already discretized in terms of random variables.

We shall look at two driving examples, the simple ODE

!bt
\begin{eqution}
u'(t) = a(t)u(t),\quad u(0)=I,
\end{equation}
!et
where $a$ and $I$ can be uncertain. If $a$ is uncertain, we assume that it
consists of uncertain piecewise constants: $a=a_i$ is a random variable
in some time interval $[t_i,t_{t_{i+1}]$. Typically, we can write
$a(t) = \sum_{i=0}^N a_i\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$, with $\hat\baspsi_i$ being P0
elements in time, and $a_i$ are the unknown coefficients (in this case we
count to $i$ from 0 to $N$ and consider $I$ as certain).

We also address stationary PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\nabla\cdot(\dfc(x)\nabla u(\x)) = -f(\x)\mbox{ in }\Omega,
\end{equation}
!et
with appropriate Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions at the boundary,
The coefficients $\dfc$ and $f$ are assumed to be stochastic quantities
discretized in terms expansions, e.g., $\dfc = \sum_{i=0}^N\dfc_i\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$,
where $\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$ is some spatial discretization -- think of,
for instance, of piecewise constant P0 finite elements or global sine
functions.
