idx{polynomial chaos}

The purpose of this chapter is show how the method of *polynomial
chaos* just applies simple ideas from Chapter ref{ch:approx:global} to
perform *stochastic uncertainty analysis* of differential
equations. We assume that we have some function $u(\x,t;\zeta)$, where
$\zeta$ is a vector of *random parameters* $(\zeta_0,\ldots,\zeta_N)$
that introduces uncertainty in the problem. Note that the uncertainty
is described by $M+1$ stochastic scalar parmeters and is therefore
*discretized*. If we have temporal or spatial stochastic processes or
stochastic space-time fields, these are continuous, and the
mathematical formulations become considerably more
complicated. Assuming the uncertainty to be described by a set of
discrete stochastic *variables* represents the same simplification as
we introduced in earlier chapters where we assumed the solution to be
discrete, $u(\x)\approx\sum_ic_i\baspsi_i(\x)$, and worked with
variational forms in finite-dimensional spaces. We could, as briefly
shown in Chapter ref{ch:approx:global}, equally well worked with variational
forms in *infinite-dimensional* spaces, but the theory would involve
Sobelov spaces rather than the far more intuitive vector spaces. In
the same manner, stochastic processes and fields and their
mathematical theory are avoided when assuming the uncertainty to be
already discretized in terms of random variables.

There are some excellent expositions of polynomial chaos in the recent
literature by Xiu cite{Xiu_2009,Xiu_2010}. However, for the reader
with an understanding of Chapter ref{ch:approx:global} in this book, the authors
think the ideas can be conveyed much faster using those approximation
concepts rather than the more traditional exposition in the literature.

======= Sample problems =======

We shall look at two driving examples to illustrate the methods.

===== ODE for decay processes =====

A simple ODE, governing decay processes cite{Langtangen_decay}, reads

!bt
\begin{equation}
u'(t) = a(t)u(t),\quad u(0)=I,
\end{equation}
!et
where $a$ and $I$ can be uncertain. If $a$ is uncertain, we assume that it
consists of uncertain piecewise constants: $a=a_i$ is a random variable
in some time interval $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$. Typically, we can write
$a(t) = \sum_{i=0}^M a_i\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$, with $\hat\baspsi_i$ being P0
elements in time, and $a_i$ are the unknown coefficients (in this case we
count to $i$ from 0 to $M$ and consider $I$ as certain).

!bnotice Stochastic ODE
To be specific, we let $a$ be a scalar uncertain constant and let also
$I$ be uncertain. Then
we have two stochastic variables, $M=2$: $\zeta_0=a$ and $\zeta_1=I$.
$M=2$.

The analytical solution to this ODE is $u(t)=Ie^{-at}$. With only $I$ as
stochastic variable, we see that the solution is simply a linear function
of $I$, so if $I$ has a Gaussian probability distribution, so has $u$ for
any $t$, with expectation and variance

!bt
\begin{align*}
\E{u} &= \E{I}e^{-at},\\
\Var{u} &= \Var{I}e^{2at}\tp
\end{align*}
!et
However, as soon as $a$ is stochastic, the problem is, from a stochastic
view point *nonlinear*, so there is no simple transformation of the
probability distribution for $a$ or its statistics.

===== The stochastic Poission equation =====

We also address the stationary PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
-\nabla\cdot(\dfc(x)\nabla u(\x)) = -f(\x)\mbox{ in }\Omega,
\end{equation}
!et
with appropriate Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions at the boundary,
The coefficients $\dfc$ and $f$ are assumed to be stochastic quantities
discretized in terms of expansions, e.g.,
$\dfc = \sum_{i=0}^M\dfc_i\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$,
where $\hat\baspsi_i(\x)$ is some spatial discretization -- think of,
for instance, of piecewise constant P0 finite elements or global sine
functions, and the parameters $\dfc_i$ as the random uncertain variables
in the problem. We form some final vector $(\zeta_0,\ldots,\zeta_M)$
with all the random parameters, from $\dfc(\x)$ only, from $f(\x)$ only, or
as a combination of randomness in $\dfc$ and $f$. Here, one can include
randomness in boundary conditions as well.

!bnotice 1D model problem
A specific 1D problem for heat conduction,

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\dfc(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
\right) = 0,\quad x\in\Omega = [0,L],\]
!et
may have two materials with $\dfc$ as an uncertain
constant in each material. Let $\Omega = \Omega_0 = [0,\hat L]
\cup\Omega_1 = [\hat L, 0]$, where
$\Omega_i$ is material number $i$. Let $\dfc_i$ be the corresponding
uncertain heat conduction coefficient value.
Now we have $M=2$, and $\zeta_0=\dfc_0$ and $\zeta_1=\dfc_1$.

======= Basic principles =======

The *fundamental idea* in polynomial chaos theory
is that we now assume the mapping from an input parameter
$\bm{zeta}=(\zeta_0,\ldots,\zeta_M) \in W$ to $u$,
to $u$, to be smooth
enough be approximated by *the sum*

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(\x;\bm{\zeta}) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} c_i\baspsi_i(\bm{\zeta})
=\ \sum_{j\in\If} c_j\baspsi_j \in V \tp
label{pc:fem:approx:ufem2}
\end{equation}
!et
This is the same formula as we used for approximation in Chapter
(ref{pc:fem:approx:ufem2}).
Note that $\hbox{dim} W = M+1$, while $\hbox{dim} V = N+1$.

Another basic principle in polynomial chaos theory is to choose the
basis functions in $V$, $\baspsi_i(\x)$,
as *orthogonal polynomials*. The reason is that this choice has the
potential that the sum (ref{pc:fem:approx:ufem2}) may converge very fast
so $N$ can be kept small.

!bnotice Polynomial chaos expansions may have many unknowns!
We have $M+1$ uncertain parameters so the approximation problem
takes place in a $M+1$ dimensional space, constrary to previous chapters
where $M$ would be physical space, $M=1,2,3$. For each variable, we
will need a set of basis functions to represent the variation in that
variable.
[hpl: Formula for number of terms!]
The parameter $N$ grows expontially with $M$, so the method is potentially
very heavy if we should just utilize a standard finite element method as
expansion. The geometry of the $W$ space is also very simple as each
parameter is supposed to the defined over an interval so that $W$ is
a hypercube.x

!bnotice Remark on terminology
The development of the theory in this chapter builds on the seminal work
on polynomial chaos theory by Roger Ghanem and co-workers. This theory
expands functions in Hermite polynomials, which was a great success for a
range of Gaussian engineering problems. To obtain faster convergence
in non-Gaussian problems, functions were expanded in other families of
orthogonal polynomials, which is the view we take here, but the method
is known as *generalized* polynomial chaos, often abbreviated gPC.
In this text, however, we use the shorter term Polynomial Chaos for all
expansions in terms of global orthogonal polynomials.

===== Basic statistical results =====

Our task is to compute the coeffiients $c_i$. When these are known, we
can easily compute the statistics of the response $u$ of the differential
equation, or any other quantity derived from $u$. For example, the
expectation of $u$ is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\E{u} = \E{\sum_{j\in\If} c_j\baspsi_j} = \sum_{j\in\If} \E{c_j}\baspsi_j
\end{equation}
!et
