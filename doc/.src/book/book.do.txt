__Preface.__
This easy-to-read book introduces the basic ideas and technicalities of
least squares, Galerkin, and weighted residual methods for solving
partial differential equations. Special emphasis is put on finite element
methods.

========= Quick overview of the finite element method =========
label{ch:overview}

Purpose: Get to the point! The rest of the text is filled with details,
and it is easy for a newcomer to drown in those details. The first
chapter runs quickly through the *ideas* and outlines enough math to
indicate the nature of the method.
