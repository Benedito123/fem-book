TITLE:  Introduction to Numerical Methods for Variational Problems
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen  {copyright|CC BY} at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo

__Preface.__
This easy-to-read book introduces the basic ideas and technicalities of
least squares, Galerkin, and weighted residual methods for solving
partial differential equations. Special emphasis is put on finite element
methods.
